Pre-treat by pouring just-boiled water over the seeds and soak 12–24 hours to soften the hard coat. Fill germination bed  with Soil : Sand : Compost in a 1:1:1 mix. Sow ~1 cm deep; in beds space seeds ~5 cm apart in rows, germination usually starts in about 1–2 weeks with fresh, pre-treated seed.",
