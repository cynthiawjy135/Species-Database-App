        "etymology": "Aleurites is from Greek aleuron meaning “flour/meal,” referring to a mealy coating, and moluccana denotes “from the Moluccas (Maluku Islands, Indonesia)",

        "identification_characters": "A medium–large tree; leaves alternate, large, simple and often 3-lobed (especially on young shoots), underside pale/silvery; leaf stalk very long; sap milky; flowers white in branching clusters; fruit a hard-shelled drupe ~4–6 cm, green when young, turning brown-black when ripe, with 1–2 oily “candlenuts.”",

        "seed_germination": "Collect brown mature fruits from the tree or dry endocarp. Extract seed by softening fresh fruits a few days, peeling the rind, washing, and drying; discard floaters in water and store dried seed for months at ~10–12% moisture. Because the endocarp is very hard, sun-dry the shells 2–3 days and then plunge warm shells into water (thermal shock) to crack them; protect seeds from rodents. Use a germination medium of roughly 2:1 topsoil to river sand, and sow cracked nuts 2–3 cm deep in deep polybags or a loose, deep bed (large taproot). With cracking, germination typically occurs in ~3–8 weeks (some in 3–4 weeks) and rates can exceed 80%, whereas untreated seeds may take 3–4 months and often rot.",
        "pest": "For candlenut, the most immediate nursery threat is rodents drawn to the oily kernels - protect germination beds and trays with wire mesh or fine netting and keep floors clean. In the field, fungal diseases cause defoliation and premature fruit drop, while longhorn stem borers and subterranean termites damage stems, collars, and roots. Fruits are frequently attacked by fruit flies and seed/pod borers; regular collection and destruction of fallen or infested fruits is essential.",

        "pest": "Termites are the main stem problem in teak; they eat into the heartwood, leaving hollow stems and mud galleries- once badly attacked, felling and burning is the only practical option. Leaf-eating caterpillars can strip foliage fast; do frequent inspections, keep crowns open with light pruning, and remove heavily infested leaves/branches. Wood borers make small round holes and push out sawdust-like powder; avoid wounding trees and remove/destroy infested wood. In nurseries and young plantings, sudden wilt often follows poor drainage or rough root handling - use well-drained beds, water evenly, and prune out any cankered/dying shoots below the last symptom.",

Termites and powderpost beetles attack the wood, leaving small round holes and flour-like dust - avoid wounding, keep timber off the ground, and remove badly infested pieces. Parasitic mistletoe appears as green clumps on branches; lop the branch back to healthy wood and destroy the clumps. Root and butt rots weaken trees (yellowing leaves, leaning stems, shelf-like mushrooms at the base); keep the stem base dry and uninjured, and remove badly rotted trees.

        "pest": "In nurseries of Sterculia foetida, the main problem is a leaf-rolling caterpillar that can hit 70–80% of seedlings and cause very high death rates. The larvae stitch the leaf with fine silk, roll it up, and feed inside, leaving thin “windowed” patches between the veins before moving to fresh leaves. Check beds daily and remove or destroy rolled leaves with the caterpillar inside. Protect germination beds with fine insect mesh, keep spacing and airflow good, and avoid over-lush, shaded growth. At first signs, a biological spray like a neem (azadirachtin) spray can help keep damage down.",
